## Overview

These are configuration files, scripts, lists of packages that I have available
for two types of systems: macOS and Manjaro. Manjaro is my daily driver so those
are more fleshed out and existent in this repository. This is an overview of the
core software that I use:

- Window Manager: Sway (Manjaro) and Yabai (macOS)
- Terminal emulator: Alacritty
- Terminal multiplexer: tmux
- Shell: Zsh
- Editor: Neovim
- Browser: Firefox
